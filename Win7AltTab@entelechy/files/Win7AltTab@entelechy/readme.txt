Win7 Alt-Tab Cinnamon extension

Copyright 2012-2014 Entelechy GPLv2+

Provides an Alt-Tab like that in Win7: Thumbnails in the switcher, plus window
previews.  The window title is displayed at the top of the switcher, for the
highlighted window.  Thumbnails are arranged in a grid.  In this switcher, the
traditional manners of tabbing are possible: active workspace, active app, and
all workspaces.  One may also switch workspaces while tabbing, or switch from
tabbing all windows to the windows of a single app, like in Metacity.  Press
the "Home" or "End" key to go to the beginning or end of the window list,
respectively.

To install, copy this folder to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions/, and restart
Cinnamon (Alt-F2, "r", Enter).

Based on the default Cinnamon Alt-Tab, with bits from SavageTiger's Gnome2AltTab
extension.
