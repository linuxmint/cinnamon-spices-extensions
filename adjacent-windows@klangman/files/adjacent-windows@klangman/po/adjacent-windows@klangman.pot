"When using the Left, Right, Above or Below hotkeys, activate the window that "

"- Highest in the z-order: most recently focused; this might skip over "
"visible windows that are closer to the current window.\n"
"- Closest window with a visible corner: a compromise that is designed to be "
"more like what most people would generally expect (I hope)."
