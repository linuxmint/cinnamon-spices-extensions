# Changelog

## 1.2.1

* Fixed an issue preventing the "Activate window under" hotkey from being registered unless the "Activate window below" is also defined. Thanks to [Yateen00](https://github.com/Yateen00) for reporting the issue.

## 1.2.0

* Added an option in the configuration window that will enable "warping" the mouse cursor to the center of newly focused windows. Thanks to [anaximeno](https://github.com/anaximeno) for adding the code for this feature.

## 1.1.0

* Added two configuration options to offer some advanced controls over how the algorithm works when using the "Closest with a visible corner" window selection option. These options might help some people achieve a window selection behaviour that is more to their liking.
* Moved files to a 5.4 directory as an added protection ensuring that the extension is only used in Cinnamon 5.4 or higher.
* Fixed some typos in the README.md

## 1.0.0

* Initial version commited to cinnamon spices
