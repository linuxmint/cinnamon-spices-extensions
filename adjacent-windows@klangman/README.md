# Adjacent Windows
A Cinnamon extension that allows you to define hot keys which will activate the nearest window to the current window on the left, right, above, below or underneath. There is also an option (disabled by default) to undo the window change and activate the window that previously had the focus. With this extension you can easily switch the window focus without reaching for the mouse and it's faster than using Alt-TAB. It's particularly useful for people frequently who use window tiling.

By default the Super+Alt+(arrow-keys) are defined as the hotkeys to move to adjacent windows, but this can be changed in the configuration. If you like, for instance, the Vim key bindings, you could change them to Super+h/j/k/l. The default hotkey for activating windows underneath the current window is Super+Alt+Insert (Keypad)

## Requirements
This applet requires at least Mint 21 / Cinnamon 5.4 because the Meta.Window.get_frame_rect() API is needed.

## Installation
1. Right click on the cinnamon panel and click "System Settings"
2. Click on the "Extensions" icon under the "Preferences" category
3. Click the "Download" tab and then click the "Adjacent Windows" entry
4. Click the "Install" button on the right and then return to the "Manage" tab
6. Select the new "Adjacent Windows" entry and then click the "+" button at the bottom of the window
7. Click on the gears icon to the right of the "Adjacent Windows" entry to open the configuration window so you can change the hotkeys and other options as desired.

## Feedback
Please leave a comment here on cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com or you can create an issue on my "Adjacent Windows" development GitHub repository if you encounter any issues with this extension:

https://github.com/klangman/Adjacent-Windows

This is where I develop new features and test out any new ideas I have before pushing to cinnamon-spices.

If you use this extension please let me know by "liking" it here and on my Github repository, that way I will be encouraged to continue working on the project.
