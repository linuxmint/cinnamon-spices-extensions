OSD Window 150, extension fully handled by the [Enhanced Sound Applet (sound150@claudiux)](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/306).

This extension allows to display an OSD window that can be:

  * with or without level bar,
  * with or without level value,
  * with or without '%' beside level value,
  * horizontal (the level value appears alongside the level bar),
  * vertical (the level value appears above the level bar).

All these options can be set from the Sound tab (OSD section) of the Enhanced Sound Applet settings.
