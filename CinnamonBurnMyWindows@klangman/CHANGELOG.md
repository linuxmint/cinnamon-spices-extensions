# Changelog

## 1.0.3

* Fix the location of the icon file used in the About tab of the configuration window.
* Add power management feature: Added a "Power" tab to the configuration window where you can configure BurnMyWindows to use different effects (or no effects at all) when running on battery power and the battery charge stage is below a limit you set. (disabled by default)
* Fix to properly disconnect variable bindings on extension disable / upgrade

## 1.0.2

* Fixed a bug that results in the inability to minimize/unminimze windows after disabling the Burn-My-Windows extension.

## 1.0.1

* Fix Fire and Mushroom effect presets when using a translation of Burn-My-Windows. Note: This fix will reset the prefix settings to default so you will need to reconfigure the extension to use your desired preset if you had previously setup a preset other then the default one.
* Added "Open/Close Edge" and "Open/Close Offset" options under the Magic Lamp effect settings. These options allow you to set the monitor edge location where the Magic Lamp effect will animate from/to for open and close events. The default will be the "Closest edge to mouse pointer" but you can set it to a specific edge and offset. For example, you could direct the animations to towards the Main Menu location. These options only apply to Open/Close events as the minimize/unminimize events will continue to use the location of the windows icon on the window-list as it's source/target location.
* Make the custom scale widget show tooltips when hovering over the widgets label rather than just when hovering the scale bar.

## 1.0.0

Here we are at version 1.0. I had hoped to have the full suite of effects enabled for version 1.0, but that will have to wait for version 1.1 when Cinnamon 6.6 is out ðŸ¤ž. I wanted to get this release out there since it has two fixes that makes the current feature set work without any major issues, so in that way maybe it is a suitable 1.0 release after all!

* Fixed the Magic Lamp effect to address the window flashing on minimize problem.
* Fixed the problem where no effect is activated when using "Randomized" for the "Unminimize window effect".
* Improved the wording of the Magic Lamp "Type of effect" drop down menu items.

## 0.9.9b

* Fix broken version 0.9.9, I forgot to copy over some changes from my dev branch for 0.9.9

## 0.9.9

* Added a "Reset to default" button for each effect under the "Effect Settings" tab. 
* Added an "Open effect preview window" button to "Effect Settings" tab. It opens a preview window to test out the currently selected effect in the "Show setting for effect" drop down list.
* Added a custom "scale" widget that puts the label, scale, and number in a line to save GUI space. It also "marks" the default value for the setting.
* Fixed the issue where some setting under the "Effect Settings" were not appearing properly after changing the "Show settings for effect" drop-down. It turns out that adding a common element at the end of the effect settings somehow makes the issue disappear. So I didn't really "fix" anything but adding the "Open effect preview window" button at the bottom of the effect settings section has the added benefit of avoiding the issue.
* Added a custom "About page" widget to improve the look of the about tab and changed the URLs to clickable links. Also added a "Report an issue" link and the version number to the about tab.
* Added buttons to set or clear all the random set check boxes.
* Added BMW Gnome version changes to add a random color option to the Fire effect, also added a "Nuclear" preset.
* Added an Doom setting option to manually adjust the target location for the Doom open effect so that people can work-around the Doom effect issue while I work on finding a proper fix.

## 0.9.8

* Added new effects from the Gnome version (Aura Glow, Mushroom, RGB Warp, Team Rocket)
* Added Magic Lap effect based on hermes83/compiz-alike-magic-lamp-effect (same as CinnamonMagicLamp)
* Added the ability to apply effects to the minimize & unminimize events
* Fixed an issue where the window was jumping a pixel to the right post open animation (finally!)
* Added Fire effect presets (5 pre-configured fire setups)
* Changed the Random Effects tab to use a standard List widget
* Moved the Application Specific settings options to it's own tab
* Added a custom color selection widget to save configurator GUI space
* Use WM_CLASS when adding a app specific setting if no app can be found
* Improvements to the Focus effect (from Gnome version)
* Added an "About" tab with credits to the various authors

## 0.9.7

- Added options in the configuration that allows you to define which effects will be used (if any) for dialog windows (i.e. a file open dialog). This allows you to use a more subtle or shorter running effect (i.e focus or glide) for all the dialog windows which are typically opened/closed more frequently.
- Added support for using WM_CLASS names in the "application specific settings" table in the config.
- Added two default "application specific settings" table entries for "VirtualBox" and "VirtualBoxVM. This addresses the Virtualbox issue described in the readme.md

## 0.9.6

* Enabled the "Fire" effect
* Apply a visual fix to "Incinerate" that was fixed in the Gnome extension recently
* Reordered the code to make it a bit easier to maintain

## 0.9.5

* Added a new "Focus" effect by Justin Garza

## 0.9.4

* Fixed an issue that could interfere with other Cinnamon effects by returning true from Cinnamon's _shouldAnimate(). Some effects like Restore and Manximize might occur even when they were disabled in the Cinnamon Effects setting application. Also some BurnMyWindows effect could happen on events other than window open/close events (but I didn't ever see this occur myself).

## 0.9.3

* Fix Randomized effects so that when the Doom effect is enabled under "Random Effects" it can actually be randomly selected for use

## 0.9.2

* Added application specific effect settings that override the default effects setting when a specific application window is opened/closed
* Added a "none" options to the effect drop-down lists which will perform no effect and allow the cinnamon default effect to apply
* Added a button in the General configuration tab which will add an "Application Specific Settings" table entry for the application of the window that last had the focused.

## 0.9.1

* Initial version committed to cinnamon spices
