# Changelog

## 1.1.0

* Restored the ability to blur the overview background. It was removed in 2021 for no reason that I can discern
* Added a config option to control if the blur effect is applied (defaults to on)
* Changed the maintainer to myself since it currently has no maintainer
* Added a README, CHANGELOG and version number
