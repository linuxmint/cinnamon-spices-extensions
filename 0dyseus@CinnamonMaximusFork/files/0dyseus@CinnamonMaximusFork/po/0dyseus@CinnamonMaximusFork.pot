msgid "This extension is a fork of the [Cinnamon Maximus](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/29) extension by Fatih Mete. The main difference with the original is that I removed the blacklist feature in favor of a whitelist feature. I also added a couple of options for troubleshooting and completely removed the top border of undecorated maximized windows."
