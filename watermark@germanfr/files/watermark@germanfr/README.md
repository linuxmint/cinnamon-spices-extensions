[![Screenshot](screenshot.png)][repo]

## Included watermarks
 * Cinnamon
 * Manjaro
 * Manjaro Text (Manjaro logo with text)
 * Arch
 * Linux Mint
 * Debian
 * Antergos
 * Ubuntu
 * Linux
 * All Gtk icons, including *start-here*
 * Virtually **any image from a custom location**

## Install
#### From the Cinnamon settings
Just go to `System Settings > Extensions` and search for this there.

#### From the Cinnamon Spices website
Go to [the Cinnamon Spices website][spices], download the package and extract the contents into `~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions`.

### From source
Download the sources from [here][repo] and run `./utils.sh --install`. If it doesn't work, do it manually: copy, move or link the `watermark@germanfr` folder into `~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions`.

## Changelog
See the list of changes on Github:  [https://github.com/germanfr/watermark-cinnamon/commits/master][commits].

## Issues
If you find any bug you can file an issue in the Github project page: [https://github.com/germanfr/watermark-cinnamon/issues][issues].

Make sure you have an updated version of Cinnamon and try to explain the more detailed you can what the problem is (don't just say _"it doesn't work"_ because that doesn't help at all).

Please, do not post issues in the comments of the Cinnamon Spices website because it doesn't have a notification system and I rarely see it.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, also in form of translations. Please, submit pull requests [to the repository][repo] not the spices repository, which is only a distribution channel (not even a mirror). What is in there is automatically generated and overwritten.

## License
