Compiz Cube-like animation for workspace switching

Using the standard workspace switching hotkeys Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right will show a rotating cube with the workspaces on the cube faces as the workspace switching animation.

It should now be working perfectly under all versions of Mint21+ without having to set CLUTTER_PAINT environment variable!
I tested: Mint 21 / 21.1 / 21.3 / 22 and Fedora Cinnamon-Spin 40
