# [Transparent panels - A Cinnamon extension][repo]

Transparentize your panels when there are no any maximized windows

[![Screenshot](screenshot.png)][repo]

## Supported themes
Transparent panels supports every theme in principle, but there are some themes that may not fit well. For such cases, the authors (or users) of the theme may override the `panel-transparent`, `panel-transparent-with-shadow` and `panel-semi-transparent` classes in their `cinnamon.css`, which can be enabled in the extension preferences with the option "use current theme styles".

## Installation
### Cinnamon Spices
Download it [from here][spices] or search for _"Transparent panels"_ in your Cinnamon extension settings.
### From source
To download the source and install it, execute the following as a normal user (you will need [git](https://git-scm.com/)).
``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/germanfr/cinnamon-transparent-panels.git
$ cd cinnamon-transparent-panels/ && ./utils.sh install
```
The above will download the source from Github and it will be copied to your `~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions/` folder. If you don't have git installed, you can download a zip [from here](https://github.com/germanfr/cinnamon-transparent-panels/archive/master.zip), extract it and run `$ ./utils.sh install`.

## Changelog
See the list of changes on Github:  [https://github.com/germanfr/cinnamon-transparent-panels/commits/master][commits]

## Issues
If you find any bug you can file an issue in the Github project page: [https://github.com/germanfr/cinnamon-transparent-panels/issues][issues]

Make sure you have an updated version of Cinnamon and try to explain the more detailed you can what the problem is (don't just say _"it doesn't work"_ because that doesn't help at all).

Please, do not post issues in the comments of the Cinnamon Spices website because it doesn't have a notification system and I rarely see it.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, also in form of translations. Please, submit pull requests [to the repository][repo] not the spices repository, which is only a distribution channel (not even a mirror). What is in there is automatically generated and overwritten.

## FAQ
#### 1) Is it possible to keep transparency always?
Yes, but you don't need this extension to do that. You can remove the background of your panels in the theme's `cinnamon.css`, and it will probably work better.

#### 2) System warns this extension isn't compatible with the current version of Cinnamon.
Load it anyways. I have to update the list of compatible versions each time a new version is released, so I may have missed it but probably it still works. If it doesn't, please file an [issue][issues].

#### 3) It doesn't work!
First, make sure you have the latest version of Cinnamon (or at least not a prehistoric one). I do not mantain backwards compatibility for too long, but I mark some points in time when the extension worked for that version. If you have an old version, find [here][releases] a release that is compatible with your version of Cinnamon and install it manually. If it still doesn't work or you already had an updated version, please file an [issue][issues].
