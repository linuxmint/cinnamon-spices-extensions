## Settings Overview

### Basic Transparency Controls

- **Panel Opacity**: Adjust main (taskbar) and other panels transparency (0-100%).
- **Menu Opacity**: Adjust popup menus transparency (0-100%).
- **Override Panel Color**: Enable custom panels background color instead of theme detection.
- **Choose Override Panel Color**: Select custom panels color when override is enabled.
- **Override Popup Color**: Enable separate custom color for popup menus.
- **Choose Override Popup Color**: Select custom popups color when override is enabled.

### Blur Effects

- **Blur Radius**: Intensity of blur (0-50px).
- **Saturation Multiplier**: Color vibrancy (0.0-2.0).
- **Contrast Multiplier**: Light/dark difference (0.0-2.0).
- **Brightness Multiplier**: Overall lightness (0.0-2.0).
- **Blur Opacity**: Transparency of blur layer (0.0-1.0).
- **Blur Transition Duration**: Animation speed (0.0-2.0s).
- **Background Color/Tint**: Semi-transparent overlay color.
- **Border Color**: Color of blur borders.
- **Border Width**: Thickness of borders (0-5px).

### Border Radius

- **Apply Border Radius to Main Panel**: Enable rounded corners.
- **Auto-Detect Theme Border Radius**: Match theme settings.
- **Border Radius**: Fallback value (0-20px).

### Color Override Logic

- **Auto Detection Mode**: When both override switches are disabled, the panel color is detected from the current theme and propagated to popup menus for a consistent appearance.
- **Panel Override Mode**: When "Override Panel Color" is enabled, the selected panel color is applied to the main panel and — unless a popup override is enabled — to popup menus as well.
- **Popup Override Mode**: When "Override Popup Color" is enabled, popup menus use their own custom color while the panel uses either the panel override color or the auto-detected theme color.
- **Immediate Application**: Changes to override switches or color pickers apply immediately to the panel and any active popup menus (no Cinnamon restart required).

### Advanced Settings

- **Blur Template**: Select preset templates (e.g., Frosted Glass, Wet Glass).
- **Apply Selected Template**: Reset settings to template values.
- **Style Notifications**: Propagate popup panel visual appearance to notification banner.
- **Style OSD-s**: Propagate popup panel visual appearance to OSD (Caps Lock, Num Lock, Brightness, Volume, ..).
- **Style Tooltips**: Propagate popup panel visual appearance to tooltips in panels.
- **Style AppSwitchers (Alt-Tab)**: Propagate popup panel visual appearance to AppSwitchers (Classic and 3D modes).
- **Enable Debug Logging**: For troubleshooting.
- **Show System Tray Indicator**: Toggle tray icon.

## Compatibility

- **Cinnamon Version**: 6.0, 6.2, 6.4
- **Multiversion**: Yes

## Troubleshooting and known issues

- OSD styling is made "in advance", so if you switch your "theme" and OSD's aren't styled properly, try to change CSS Panels border-radius setting.
- If effects don't apply, check theme compatibility.
- If Border Radius is not detected or valid, set it manually. 
- Enable debug logging and check `journalctl -f` for errors (or use LG).
- Reset settings if issues persist.
- Don't expect "miracles", it is only css with limited options
- Experiment - you could use color chooser to select desired color and transparency from existing elements on the screen.
