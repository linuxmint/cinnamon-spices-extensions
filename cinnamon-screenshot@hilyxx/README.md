Cinnamon-Screenshot extension
-------------------
Cinnamon extension for screenshots with modern interface and advanced options.

This extension uses Gnome-Screenshot, which works seamlessly with both X11 and Wayland, and is fully integrated into the Cinnamon desktop.

#### A wide variety of options are included to ensure a good user experience: 

* A simple editor mode with tools such as a brush, a text input field, geometric shapes, or a pixelization mode
* Three screenshot options: Full Screen, Active Window, and Selection — all with keyboard shortcuts
* A timer (up to 60 seconds)
* A preview of the screenshot along with its pixel dimensions
* A clipboard option

By default, ‘CTRL + Q’ keyboard shortcut is used to open the extension. 
You can customize this shortcut in the extension settings.


## FAQ

#### → Is this extension only compatible with Cinnamon version 6.4 (and above)?

Yes, because Cinnamon-Screenshot uses the new dialog boxes introduced in version 6.4.<br/>
This update brings more possibilities and features.

#### → Will there be more features added in the future, especially in the editor mode?

I don't think so. I want to avoid making the code even more complex, as that would require more maintenance.<br/> 
This extension is meant to provide all the basic options while remaining as stable as possible.

#### → Is this extension compatible if I use Cinnamon on a system other than Linux Mint?

Normally, there shouldn't be any compatibility issues — apart from the Cinnamon version itself.<br/>
However, some changes in system libraries may have introduced significant modifications, regressions, or bugs!
